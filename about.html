    <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>I'm an ecommerce web merchandiser turned web developer living in the northwest suburbs of Chicago. I have an amazing wife, four great kids, and a wonderful home. I once wanted to be a comic book artist. I once had a job cleaning up monkey poop. I like to bake. I try to make cakes as cool as the ones on the Food Network, but, believe it or not, it's a pretty difficult thing to do.</p>

    <p>About a year ago I was working for an ecommerce and catalog retailer in a nice office with some of the best people I've ever known. Then we all got laid off. Some job searching lead to some soul searching and I realized that, as comfortable as I was in that office with those people, I didn't love the work I was doing. I liked it, but what I really wanted was to learn more about how the web works and to build things.</p>

    <p>So, with the support of my family and friends, I gave up looking for another comfortable job I would merely like, and I signed up for Dev Bootcamp. Dev Bootcamp is an intense, nineteen week, web development training program in Chicago. It was exactly what I needed.</p>

    <p>I'll get to technical skills and all that in a minute. What you really need to know is that I know how to work with people. I've worked in customer service, retail sales, buying, and marketing (and monkey poop cleaning, don't forget about that). I've worked with creatives, executives, techies, purchasers, and more. I know how to speak up when I have something to contribute and I know how to recognize when someone else has a good idea. In short, you will like working with me.</p>

    <h2>What Can I Do?</h2>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    <p>I'm a full stack developer. I know Ruby and Rails, Javascript, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I understand how to code for a client. When I worked as a web merchandiser, part of my job was to suggest new site features and work with the dev team to implement them. So, I have been the client, and that makes it easier to understand their goals and needs as a developer.</p>

    <h3>Design and UX</h3>
    <p>I have an art and design background, but my work as a web merchandiser gave me a better understanding of design than any course I've ever taken. That experience taught me that you identify your audience and your goals first before you even begin to think about design.</p>
